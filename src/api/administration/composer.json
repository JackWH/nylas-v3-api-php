    "description": "**This API reference covers the **Administration APIs** only. See the [<b>Email and Calendar API reference</b>](https:///docs/api/v3-beta/ecc/) for information on working with Email and Calendar APIs.  The **Nylas Administration APIs** are how you query and change your Nylas applications, including the application's authentication configuration, provider settings, and webhook subscriptions. You can also use Administration APIs to query your application to list the Grants (specific permissions to access user data) that are associated with each of your Nylas applications.  The Nylas API is designed using the [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) ideology to provide simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support [standard HTTP methods](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and [standard status codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html). Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise.  ## Nylas authentication in v3  You can find more information about the Nylas Administration APIs in the main documentation set:  - [Authentication in v3](https:///docs/developer-guide/v3-authentication/)     - [Create Grants with OAuth authentication + API key](https:///docs/developer-guide/v3-authentication/hosted-oauth-apikey/)     - [Create Grants with OAuth authentication + Access token](https:///docs/developer-guide/v3-authentication/hosted-oauth-accesstoken/)     - [Create Grants with custom authentication](https:///docs/developer-guide/v3-authentication/custom/) (called \"native\" authentication in v2)     - [Create Grants with IMAP authentication](https:///docs/developer-guide/v3-authentication/imap/) - [Bulk authentication in v3](https:///docs/developer-guide/v3-authentication/bulk-auth-grants/) - [v3 event codes](https:///docs/v3-beta/event-codes/) - [Virtual Calendars in v3](https:///docs/developer-guide/v3-authentication/virtual-calendars/)",
